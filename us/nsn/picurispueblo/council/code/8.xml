      <heading>Statement of Intent and Purpose.</heading>
      <text>The Pueblo of Picuris, by its Tribal Council, hereby finds and determines that pursuant to the power vested in the Pueblo of Picuris as a sovereign Indian Tribe, the authority of the Pueblo of Picuris under the laws of the United States of America and applicable treaties, it is necessary to provide a means whereby the Pueblo can protect itself, its members, and other persons living on the lands of the Pueblo of Picuris, from people whose presence on the Pueblo lands is harmful to, or threatens harm to, the peace, health, safety, morals and general welfare of the Pueblo and its members. Such action is deemed necessary as a result of the Pueblo's interest in maintaining the aforementioned free from harm, to protect the cultural identity of the Pueblo, and to protect those residents of the Pueblo of Picuris and its exterior boundaries who may be imposed upon, harmed or otherwise disadvantaged. The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide procedural fairness to persons affected by these provisions while at the same time recognizing the need, in appropriate situations, to act immediately to remedy actual or threatened harms.</text>

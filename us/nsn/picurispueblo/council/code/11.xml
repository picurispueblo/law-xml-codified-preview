          <text>The increasing volume and variety of solid waste and hazardous waste being generated on the Pueblo of Picuris and the often-inadequate existing methods of managing solid waste and hazardous waste are creating conditions that threaten the public health, safety and welfare of tribal members and residents of the Pueblo of Picuris by contributing to land, air and water pollution, to the production of flies, rodents and litter, to the waste of dwindling natural resources, and to the general deterioration of the Pueblo of Picuris environment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>The people of the Pueblo of Picuris have a primary interest in the protection and control of the land and other natural resources affected by the improper disposal of solid waste within the Pueblo of Picuris, and the quality of such land and other natural resources must be protected to insure the health, economic, aesthetic and cultural well-being of the Pueblo of Picuris People.</text>

The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the estimate has been placed in the operating record.</text>
        <text>The cost estimate must equal the cost of closing the largest area of an MSWLF unit ever requiring a final cover at any time during the active life when the extent and manner of its operation would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by its closure plan.</text>
        <text>During the active life of the MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must annually adjust the closure estimate for inflation.</text>
        <text>The owner or operator must increase the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided, if changes to the closure plan or MSWLF unit conditions increase the maximum cost of closure at any time during the remaining active life. The owner or operator may reduce the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided under Section B herein, if the closure cost estimate exceeds the maximum cost of closure at any time during the remaining life of the MSWLF unit. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the justification for the reduction of the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance has been placed in the operating record.</text>
        <text>The owner or operator of each MSWLF unit must establish financial assurance for closure of the MSWLF unit in compliance with 40 CFR ยง258.74.

        <text>Allowable Financial Mechanisms.</text>
        <text>40 CFR ยง258.74 required that an owner or operator of an MSWLF unit provide financial assurance to ensure that funds necessary to meet the costs of closure, post-closure care and corrective action for known release will be available in a timely fashion when they are needed. There are four mechanisms available to provide financial assurance, including a trust fund; a surety bond; a letter of cred; an insurance policy; or a combination of all four mechanisms. Any mechanism(s) that is/are used by an owner or operator must comply with all of the criteria in 40 CFR ยง258.74, which is incorporated by reference herein, and must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under state, federal and Tribal law.</text>
        <text>The financial assurance mechanism(s) must be obtained by the owner or operator before the initial receipt of waste in the case of closure and post-closure care cost estimates; and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR ยง258.58, and maintained as required by 40 CFR ยงยง258.71-74.</text>
        <text>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the actual financial assurance mechanism(s) and financial assurance agreements that is/are provided by the owner or operator. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may also require in its discretion, in addition to the criteria for financial assurance under 40 CFR Part 258, that an owner or operator provide financial assurance for corrective action for other than known releases as a condition for issuing an MSWLF permit.</text>
        <text>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall also require that liability and property damage insurance coverage be provided by an owner or operator for claims arising from personal injury or property damage, including any claims from releases from an MSWLF unit.</text>
        <text>If a trust fund mechanism is used, the trustee must be an entity who has the authority to act as a trustee, and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency. Trust fund payments must be made as specified in 40 CFRยง258.74 criteria. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the terms of any trust agreement which is to be used as a financial assurance mechanism. The trust agreement shall be irrevocable. Trust funds shall only be release to reimburse the owner or operator for closure, post-closure and corrective action costs actually incurred, but only if sufficient funds remain in the trust to cover the remaining costs.</text>
        <text>If any surety bond is used, the surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties in federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</text>
        <text>If any letter of credit is used, the issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letter of credit and whose letter of credit operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency.</text>

Specifically, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall conduct investigations when a complaint is received by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other tribal agency believes that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred.</text>

      <text>In the case of an apparent violation of this Ordinance, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to the person(s) apparently responsible for the violation, and, if the apparent violation occurred on property owned by a person other than the alleged violator, a Notice of Violation shall also be issued to the landowner.</text>
      <text>In the case of a continuing violation or a threatened violation, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department is authorized to issue a Cease and Desist Order to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring.</text>
      <text>Failure to comply with a Cease and Desist Order shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. Both a Notice of Violation and a Cease and Desist Order may be issued for a single incident. A Notice of Violation will include a Summons to appear before the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court at an enforcement hearing at a specified time and date, and shall advise the alleged violator that failure to appear may result in the imposition of civil penalties.</text>
